### Tips
Experiment with comparison operators (`<`, `>`, `===`, ect.) in the node REPL (launch by typing `node` command in WSL)

Work in small pieces, try to use 'else' statements as little as possible or preferably not at all

To help figure out how to use variables `hungry` and `availableTime` inside the functions, try outputting their value to the terminal:

```javascript
function whatToDoForLunch(hungry, availableTime) {
  console.log("hungry is", hungry);
  console.log("availableTime is", availableTime);
}
```
